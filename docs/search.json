These are:\n\nReproducibility in HTA\nReading, cleaning, and storing HTA data\nReporting HTA results\nHTA model robustness\nHTA functionality and workflows\n\nExample projects within these themes could be, but are not limited to:\n\nExtending existing packages e.g. extended multistate model packages to explicitly incorporate cost-effectiveness analysis.\nBetter handling of sensitivity analysis data\nImproving visualisation of economic evaluation data, statistics and uncertainties\nImproving ease of use e.g. simply by adding an extra level of abstraction to existing R package so that new higher-level functions can be exploited by practitioners and policymakers\nAI for model creating, checking and reporting\n\n\n\nOutputs\nIncluding the following\n\nKick-start early-stage collaboration among academics, government and industry.\nSet-up new networks to promote the exchange of ideas, information sharing, best practice, and other research goals.\nStrengthen existing and establish new communities of interest.\nPropose future collaboration and projects.\nEstablish a hackathon format for future events around other economic evaluations themes.\nDevelop a set of R packages that can be used by the wider health economics community.\nDevelop a set of training materials that can be used by the wider health economics community.\nFun and enjoyment!\n\nTo ensure a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates, we have a strict code of conduct.\nMore details can be found in FAQ.\n\n\nWorkshop Agenda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\nSession\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n\nDAY 1\n\n\n\n\n10:00\nRegistration & Welcome breakfast\n\n\n\n\nIntroductions, setup, and aims\n\n\n\n\nProblem presentations and team forming\n\n\n\n12:00 - 13:00\nNetworking Lunch\n\n\n\n13:00 - 17:30\nCoding/skills sessions\n\n\n\n17:30\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n18:00\nEvening meal/drinks\n\n\n\nDAY 2\n\n\n\n\n9:00 - 10:00\nSkills session\n\n\n\n10:00 - 10:30\nBreakfast\n\n\n\n10:30\nSmall team project work\n\n\n\n12:00 - 12:45\nNetworking Lunch\n\n\n\n12:45\nSmall team project work\n\n\n\n15:30 - 16:00\nPresentations, feedback, wrap-up and finish\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is a hackathon?\nA hackathon is an event where participants can learn, build and share their created computer code over the course of a few days in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Participants don’t have to be an expert programmer. The event is designed to be inclusive and fun.\n\n\nWhy people should take part?\nThis event will be a unique opportunity to meet and form a community of like-minded people, hear from expert speakers and have the chance to develop your innovative ideas to solve HTA problems.\n\n\nWhat are the attendance costs?\nThe event will be free to attend. We will provide financial support with travel and accommodation for those that qualify. Please indicate in the application form. However, there is the expectation that those who can cover their own travel costs from their own funds will do so.\n\n\nWho can apply?\nThe workshop is open to all. Attendees must be over 18. Because of the nature of the event attendees must already have some grounding in using R. The most important thing is enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. We are interested in people who have domain expertise but are not expert programmers, and the other way around. There will be some up-skilling talks and demonstrations during the workshop in specialist areas.\n\n\nHow many participants?\nThe number of spaces will be limited to 30 participants.\n\n\nIs there training?\nSkills sessions will provide additional capacity building in R and software engineer from experiences experts. The RSE are employed to write software engineer quality code in a research environment and so will offer guidance and advice with knowledge from both perspectives. Sessions will cover e.g. unit testing, literate programming, package development, git and GitHub, but there will be some flexibility catered for, depending on the demands of the group.\n\n\nIs there food and drink?\nA buffet-style breakfast and lunch will be provided on both days, ensuring to cater for dietary requirements. An evening meal and networking event will be arranged for the end of day one at Riddel Hall at QUB. Coffee and refreshments will be made available throughout the event. This is an important component for this type of event.\n\n\nWhy Queens University Belfast?\nQUB is a global research institute with state-of-the-art computing facilities. In particular, a bespoke computer room within the School of Electronics, Engineering and Computer Science has been fitted for teaching Data Analytics. These computers have all the latest software and packages, including R, and high processing power. This space has been used before for external events and is a perfect space to hold this event.\n\n\nHow are the teams formed and problem selection?\nBefore the start of the hackathon there will be an open conversation for idea generation, about what particular problems the participants are most interested in tackling. Then at the event itself, a handful of project will be pitched on the opening morning and participants are free to pick and choose which they would like to work on.\n\n\nWho are the instructors, support experts and presenters?\nThere will be a participant project lead for each group of 3-5 people. There will also be R experts on-hand “floating” around the groups.\n\n\n\nLocation\nBoth days will be held at Queen’s University Belfast, Ireland.\n\n\n\n\nRegistration\nRegister Now\n\n\nContact Us\nTo learn more, don’t hesitate to get in touch\nEmail: contact@example.com\n\nThis event was kindly funded by the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS)"
