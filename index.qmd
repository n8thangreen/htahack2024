## A 2 day event in Belfast, Ireland for health economists, statisticians and R users

### Event details
Are you interested in using the power of R programming to tackle problems in health economics?

Do you want to join up with a community of like-minded people?

Over 2 days in November 2019 Imperial College London will be hosting the first health economics in R hackathon.

This will involve small group project work developing novel health economics tools, as well as training in related data science skills.

See the agenda for more details.  

This event is open to participants of all levels and experience in using R.

Financial support for travel and over-night accommodation is available to those that qualify.



Example applications could be:

* Extending existing packages e.g. extended multistate model packages to explicitly incorporate cost-effectiveness analysis.

* Better handling of sensitivity analysis data

* Improving visualisation of economic evaluation data, statistics and uncertainties​

* Improving ease of use e.g simply be adding an extra level of abstraction to existing R package so that new higher-level functions can be exploited by practitioners and policymakers

 

Outputs will include:

* Kick-start early-stage collaboration among academics, government and industry.

* Set-up new networks to promote the exchange of ideas, information sharing, best practice, and other research goals.

* Strengthen existing and establish new communities of interest.

* Propose future collaboration and projects.

* Establish a hackathon format for future events around other economic evaluations themes.



To ensure a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates, we have a strict code of conduct.
