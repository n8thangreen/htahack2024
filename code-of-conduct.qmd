title: "Code of Conduct"
---

We are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the conference organizers.

This code of conduct applies to all participants and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos and discussion forum, Slack channels and Twitter.

Participants agree to:

-   Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.

-   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert any member of the conference team in person.

-   Take care of each other. Alert a member of the conference team if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

Please speak with Felicity Lamrock, or Nathan Green if you have any concerns. If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the conference. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the conference team with a concise description of your grievance.)

We thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
